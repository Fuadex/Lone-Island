# Lone-Island
Independent Studies Project

This is a bit messy repo but in the end the most important chunks of the project were:

Similar.py
Processing.pde

Similar.py would take lyrics and translate the last words in a verse into some form of a similarly nuanced word
Processing.py would look up images from Flickr API and parse image addresses

Unfortunately, the entire pipeline wasn't streamlined at the time and so I had to chuck the line addresses manually into Unity as texture hyperlinks
